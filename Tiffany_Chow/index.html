            <h2>THE WITCH </h2>
            <p>A witch who lives alone in the forest, arrogant yet powerful. She has the gift of understanding magic at a young age, getting everything she ever wanted as if fate is always on her side. It throws her into the unreturnable path of using dark magic...âš˜</p>

            <h2>Title</h2>
            <p>This is an original 3D character I create for fun, it's in a mystical story base, and the dark color on her hand and eyes are not makeup but a curse of using dark magic. However, she wasn't effect by it yet
the idea comes from, talented artists and musical often die at a young age the spirit of fearlessness and racnagniess is questionable but what they left is truly stonishing( I do not encourage this attitude but it is fun to analyze in fiction</p>
