            <h2>Don't Look </h2>
            <p>The act of ‘looking’ amongst people is always a two-party affair: the seer and the seen, the viewer and the viewed; the observer and the observed. However, no instance of perception is the same, and the experiences of each role are not always shared or voluntary. The conflicting feelings that arise from this affair may bleed into any area of an individual’s life as they begin to consider how others may perceive them based on their appearance, interests, behaviors, and ideas. With overpowering insecurities and anxiety, the role of the seen is oftentimes overwhelming and frightening as it is the more vulnerable to the two roles.
			<br>
			Don’t Look is an interactive visual narrative that follows a girl throughout the five stages of  her youth as she grapples with her contradictory fears and desires regarding perception and attention. The array of vibrantly colored doodles and unsettling imagery simultaneously tempt and disconcert the viewer in order to mirror the inner conflict experienced by the girl as the viewed.
			<br>
			The viewer is invited to look for the girl in black and white to proceed through the narrative. </p>
