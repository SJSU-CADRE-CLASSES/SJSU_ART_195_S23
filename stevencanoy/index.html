            <h2>Beyond the Surface</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create something fun for people to engage with so I made stereograms because they are a fun way to challenge our eyes and our brains. Stereograms allow us to see images that are not immediately visable to the naked eye. When we look at a stereogram, our brain has to work hard to piece together the hidden image, and when we finally see it, there's a sense of satisfaction and excitement. The element of surprise and discovery in stereograms is what makes them so enjoyable to look at.</p>

            <h2>Title</h2>
            <p>This div has both an image and text. It is inside a div with class "column-1" so it will take up the
                whole width of the page on both mobile and browser. There is also a "column-3" class that takes up
                one-third of the page.</p>
