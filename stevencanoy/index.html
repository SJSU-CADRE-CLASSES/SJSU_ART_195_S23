            <h2>Beyond the Surface</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create something fun for people to engage with so I made stereograms because they are a fun
                way to challenge our eyes and our brains. Stereograms allow us to see images that are not immediately
                visable to the naked eye. When we look at a stereogram, our brain has to work hard to piece together the
                hidden image, and when we finally see it, there's a sense of satisfaction and excitement. The element of
                surprise and discovery in stereograms is what makes them so enjoyable to look at.</p>

            <p>I got a lot of questions about how stereograms are made and I was able to explain that there are a few different ways. The easiest way is an online converter but you cant control the optics of the image. The other option is to create the depth map on photoshop and upload it onto a program like Sirds or an online converter with limitations. The best option to have more range in what you create is to use Blender. First you need to know how to make a depth map image. You can create a scene in Blender and blackout the background light. Then, you create your model and texture it white. Finally, import a light and adjust it so the camera can see the white representing closer and the shadows as farther away. Then render the single image and import your depth map into a program like Sirds or an online converter. Sirds works best for me because it gives me more freedom to play with depth and importing different textures.</p>
