            <h2>Piece of Nightmare </h2>
            <p>This virtual world in Unity is inspired from the pressure of getting good grades and being successful. When I first came to the United States as an international student, my grades were the biggest concern. It was challenging to keep up with my studies because English was not my mother tongue. Language and the new school environmentâ€™s teaching styles were clearly different from where I lived. Therefore, my first semester was a mess and I got bad grades. This trauma had a bad influence on my anxiety; yet, it pushed me to study hard and motivated me to adapt to a new environment. Grades always followed and bothered me like a scary zombie herd. In a zombie film, zombies keep chasing after people to eat them and I felt exactly the same. This 3D world presents my inner fear and pressure that never ends. I recreated them to appreciate my biggest fear that I have been fighted.</p>
