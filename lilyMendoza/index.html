            <h2>Anything But Human</h2>
            <p>
            Anything But Human is a virtual horror coaster experience. 
            As an artist, I tend to avoid serious or controversial topics, political or social. 
            Misogyny and sexualization of the female body has become so prevalent in our society 
            that we've been conditioned to recognize certain instances as normal. 
            From the perspective of a feminine bodied person, these cases have simply become occurrences 
            we have to put up with or prepare for. I want to poke at the problem and reemphasize that there is one. 
            They may seem small at times, but little actions can create an unsafe and uncomfortable environment on the daily. 
            <br>
            There is an error in the system. Unfortunately, in the real world, there is no safety net of the glitch to fix it.
            <br>
             I invite you to take a seat on the ride. Here, you are anything but human.
