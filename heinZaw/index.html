            <h2>Cycle of Being</h2>
            <p>
        Have you ever looked into the depths of your soul and asked
        yourself: what is the meaning of life? Have you ever felt the weight of monotony,
        as if you were trapped in an endless cycle? Or have you ever thought about whether life has lost all meaning?

<br><br><br><br>
        "The end of life is death, it is emptiness, and there is no meaning at the end. So we have to say,<br>
         there is meaning in the process. But when the process betrays us, we look at the end again and comfort ourselves and say,<br>
        'Since the end is the same, why should you care about the process?'‚Äù -----Zhou Guoping<br>

<br><br><br><br>
        Think of 2D animation parts as your early life and late life, 3D animation part  as your middle life.
        Every day feels like a repetition, a routine that we have to follow, Yet we still don't know what fate will bring,
        Will it be tomorrow's promise or tragedy's sting?
