            <p>
                I am exploring ADD but from my perspective and how it feels like it affects me
                in my daily life. I want to demonstrate how challenging it is to register
                information due or mentally stay present due to what feels like mental teleportation.
                But in the process, I am able to conceptualize my ideas and designs of my art. I want
                to also portray that this flaw of mine has developed into my greatest strength.
                This work also features a metal sculpture that represents my consciousness.

                The sculpture is inspired by an indigenous dream catcher. My intention is
                to portray my consciousness and the spontaneity of powerful thoughts that
                stem from the condition in a visual, but also physical form. The video projected
                footage conveys my mind that explores consciously generated worlds and memories,
                filling my head with colorful thoughts and possibilities. It does not just influence
                my mind, but does so in a way so strongly that it triggers emotion, causing my mind
                to get lost in its thoughts.</p>
