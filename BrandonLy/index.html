            <h2>"This Must Be The Place" </h2>
            <p>This 3D environment allows the audience to peer into a safe space: Loving memories of the neighborhood where I grew up, personal drawings that keep me motivated, and pieces from my own life I brought into the digital space. An open invitation to wander freely into my deepest thoughts.

            <h2>"This Must Be The Place"</h2>
            <p>You are the pilot. You are the navigator of this unknown territory. See the world as you see it and condemn the intrusive thoughts that hold you back. Though it may not seem clear at times, trust your instincts. Follow the path diligently. And before you know it, you will be in the place that you were meant to be in.</p>
