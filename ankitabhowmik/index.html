            <p>My game the house you left me is the story of a woman who is exploring a house. The house has been left
                to her by her best friend, who has been found dead in the house under mysterious circumstances. This is
                a short, interactive game that provides two different endings depending on choices made by the player.
                It explores themes of isolation, acceptance, and grief.</p>
