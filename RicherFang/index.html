            <p>
              The environment you live in, and the world you choose or are
              forced to witness, can deeply affect the human mind and body. What
              happens to the mind when experiencing all this negativity? What,
              in turn, happens to the body when the mind is corrupted by said
              negativity? This project sets out to explore a negative mind, one
              filled with nothing but the misery and suffering of the world, one
              where no matter where you go, it seems there is no way out.

            <h2>Initial Draft Up</h2>
            <p>
              Initially, the viewer would be situated in a dark labyrinth, the
              only light barely lit with a red dim, the viewer, guided by the
              long passageways will be led to various rooms throughout the maze.
              These rooms will be filled with different video assets, detailing
              the cruelty found in this world. Poverty, crime, racial
              discrimination, death and famine - things typically ignored by
              social media will be constantly replayed in video format, looping
              as if thatâ€™s all the mind can think about.
            </p>
            <br />

              The whole premise of this project would be situated in the mind,
              as negative thoughts erupts from within, it slowly corrupts and
              rots the brain. As such, I thought it would be fitting to have the
              labyrinth be inside a brain, which would obviously be a symbol of
              the mind.
