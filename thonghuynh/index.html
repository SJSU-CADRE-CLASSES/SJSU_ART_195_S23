            <h2>FLOW</h2>
            <p>The project is about sharing a personal view towards the flow of everything in life (ultimately time,
                space, and one’s life). Though hardly perceived, the “flow” can be seen clearly at most once within the
                stillness; or, perhaps, when we are one with it.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The story takes place on a tranquil stone and sand island high up in the skies. From a distance, the
                stones on the island appear immobile; nevertheless, as part of the “flow,” the player can trigger the
                memory of the stone when approaching it, causing it to float up like it once did.</p>
            <br>

            <p>With the guidance of magical sand, a crimson thread of fate unveils itself to guide the player through
                the area ahead and travel toward the hourglass of time. Time, symbolized by the hourglass within the
                World Tree’s eye, is the soul of everything, as it witnesses all walks of life and binding all beings
                together, weaving in a thread of one’s fate and creating the undulating flow of one’s life.</p>

            <p>This div has both an image and text. It is inside a div with class "column-1" so it will take up the
                whole width of the page on both mobile and browser. There is also a "column-3" class that takes up
                one-third of the page.</p>
