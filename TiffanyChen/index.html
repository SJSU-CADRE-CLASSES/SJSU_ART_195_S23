            <h2>Can I Get A Hug? </h2>
            <p>Everybody has a part of themselves that would want to do something bad once in their life but we can’t because we, as grown humans, grew up and were taught how to act and behave in this society. Our “ego” tells us what we want but have to get it in an acceptable way that follows the rules of society. And we envy those, Joker and child, who can work their way around not following these rules. These two might not have the same intention but they have the same psychological mindset. You never know how much a child knows, and you never know how far Joker will go. </p>
