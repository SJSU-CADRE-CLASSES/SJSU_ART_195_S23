            <h2>Virtual Connection </h2>
            <p>Imagine a world where people talk to machines….

Well… almost. What you see in front of you is me! Well, a version of me presented to you as I want to be seen! This is a live2D model connected to the program Vtube Studio that allows me to communicate and interact with you from the comfort of my computer screen. The model captures my facial movements, voice, and physical movements to give you the feeling of my presence despite the fact that you cannot see the “real” me. Come talk to me! I’d love to hear what you have to say! Do you feel silly talking to an animated drawing? Does it feel like I am really there? Can you be sure I am a person behind the screen or an incredibly intelligent AI responding to your voice? So many questions, only one way to answer…

            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>Drawn in procreate, animated and rigged in Live2D Cubism, and executed through Vtube Studio, this is my very own virtual avatar. In the gallery space, I set up a monitor with a built in microphone and webcam, connected it to my laptop in another room and interacted with the guests coming into the theater. Setting up the animation parameters in Live2D, Vtube studio would link these animations to my face so that the model would mirror my facial movements and create the illusion of talking to a real (animated) person.</p>

            <h2>Expressions</h2>
            <p>In Live2D I was able to create expressions that I could turn on and off while still have Vtube Studio capture my facial and head movements</p>

            <h2>Animations</h2>
            <p>These animations are made in Live2D and are linked to a button press and will play this animation. If there are pieces of the model that are used in these animations, they overwrite my facial inputs.</p>
