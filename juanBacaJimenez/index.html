            <h2>Natural and Digital Bloom</h2>
            <p>Natural and Digital Bloom includes both real organic elements and digitally produced images. It plays
                with the idea of expressing beauty from the natural world, but also how beautiful the result of an
                artificial element can be displayed after being created through virtual space. Also, the natural aspect
                for this work is to bring the essence of being around nature for the audience, but also being surrounded
                by the digital realm of things because that's the world we live in. It is very challenging, yet
                beautiful at the same time to live between both real and virtual worlds.</p>
